## Background and Description

"Monster Shop" is a fictitious e-commerce platform where users can register to place items into a shopping cart and 'check out'. Users who work for a merchant can mark their items as 'fulfilled'; the last merchant to mark items in an order as 'fulfilled' will automatically set the order status to "shipped". Each user role will have access to some or all CRUD functionality for application models.

2. 'packaged' means all merchants have fulfilled their items for the order, and has been packaged and ready to ship
3. 'shipped' means an admin has 'shipped' a package and can no longer be cancelled by a user
4. 'cancelled' - only 'pending' and 'packaged' orders can be cancelled
