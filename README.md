# Monster Shop
BE Mod 2 Week 4/5 Group Project (Part 1)

## Background and Description

"Monster Shop" is a fictitious e-commerce platform where users can register to place items into a shopping cart and 'check out'. Users who work for a merchant can mark their items as 'fulfilled'; the last merchant to mark items in an order as 'fulfilled' will automatically set the order status to "shipped". Each user role will have access to some or all CRUD functionality for application models.

Students will be put into 3 or 4 person groups to complete the project.\n

## Learning Goals

### Rails
* Create routes for namespaced routes
* Implement partials to break a page into reusable components
* Use Sessions to store information about a user and implement login/logout functionality
* Use filters (e.g. `before_action`) in a Rails controller
* Limit functionality to authorized users
* Use BCrypt to hash user passwords before storing in the database

### ActiveRecord
* Use built-in ActiveRecord methods to join multiple tables of data, calculate statistics and build collections of data grouped by one or more attributes

### Databases
* Design and diagram a Database Schema
* Write raw SQL queries (as a debugging tool for AR)

## Requirements

- must use Rails 5.1.x
- must use PostgreSQL
- must use 'bcrypt' for authentication
- all controller and model code must be tested via feature tests and model tests, respectively
- must use good GitHub branching, team code reviews via GitHub comments, and use of a project planning tool like github projects
- must include a thorough README to describe their project

## Permitted

- use FactoryBot to speed up your test development
- use "rails generators" to speed up your app development

## Not Permitted

- do not use JavaScript for pagination or sorting controls

## Permission

- if there is a specific gem you'd like to use in the project, please get permission from your instructors first

## User Roles

1. Visitor - this type of user is anonymously browsing our site and is not logged in
1. Regular User - this user is registered and logged in to the application while performing their work; can place items in a cart and create an order
1. Merchant Employee - this user works for a merchant. They can fulfill orders on behalf of their merchant. They also have the same permissions as a regular user (adding items to a cart and checking out)
3. Merchant Admin - this user works for a merchant, and has additional capabilities than regular employees, such as changing merchant info.
3. Admin User - a registered user who has "superuser" access to all areas of the application; user is logged in to perform their work

## Order Status

1. 'pending' means a user has placed items in a cart and "checked out" to create an order, merchants may or may not have fulfilled any items yet
2. 'packaged' means all merchants have fulfilled their items for the order, and has been packaged and ready to ship
3. 'shipped' means an admin has 'shipped' a package and can no longer be cancelled by a user
4. 'cancelled' - only 'pending' and 'packaged' orders can be cancelled

## Timeframe
The following is an anticipated timeline of how these stories should be completed in order to be finished by 12/23/19

* Monday: Story 1 && Story 10 - Story 12
* Tuesday: Story 13 - Story 16
* Wednesday: Story 2 - Story 9
* Thursday: Story 17 - Story 22
* Friday: Story 23 - Story 26
* Saturday: Story 27 - Story 30
* Sunday: Story 31 - Story 33
* Monday: Story 34 - Story 37


## Not Everything can be FULLY Deleted

In the user stories, we talk about "CRUD" functionality. However, it's rare in a real production system to ever truly delete content, and instead we typically just 'enable' or 'disable' content. Users, items and orders can be 'enabled' or 'disabled' which blocks functionality (users whose accounts are disabled should not be allowed to log in, items which are disabled cannot be ordered, orders which are disabled cannot be processed, and so on).

Disabled content should also be restricted from showing up in the statistics pages. For example: if an item is disabled, it should not appear in a list of "popular items".

Be careful to watch out for which stories allow full deletion of content, and restrictions on when they apply.

## Deploying to Heroku

User Story 1, Deploy your application to Heroku

As a visitor or user of the site
I will perform all user stories
By visiting the application on Heroku.
Localhost is fine for development, but
the application must be hosted on Heroku.
```

---

## Navigation
This series of stories will set up a navigation bar at the top of the screen and present links and information to users of your site.

There is no requirement that the nav bar be "locked" to the top of the screen.

### Completion of these stories will encompass the following ideas:

- the navigation is built into app/views/layouts/application.html.erb or loaded into that file as a partial
- you write a single set of tests that simply click on a link and expect that your current path is what you expect to see
- your nav tests don't need to check any content on the pages, just that current_path is what you expect

You will need to set up some basic routing and empty controller actions and empty action view files.

As a visitor
When I visit the login path
I see a field to enter my email address and password
When I submit valid information
If I am a regular user, I am redirected to my profile page

## User Profile Page
When a user who is not a merchant nor an admin logs into the system, they are taken to a profile page under a route of "/profile".

### Admins can act on behalf of users
Admin users can access a namespaced route of "/admin/users" to see an index page  of all non-merchant/non-admin users, and from there see each user. This will allow the admin to perform every action on a user's account that the user themselves can perform. Admin users can also "upgrade" a user account to become a merchant account.

## Shopping Cart and Checkout
This is what this app is all about: how a user can put things in a shopping cart and check out, creating an order in the process. We want to add functionality to the cart to increment and decrement the quantity within the cart.

### Visitors and Regular Users only
Merchants and Admin users cannot order items. This will cause a conflict in the project if an admin upgrades a user to a merchant and that user had previous orders of their own. We're not going to worry about this conflict.

```
[ ] done

User Story 23, Adding Item Quantity to Cart

As a visitor
When I have items in my cart

```

```
[ ] done

User Story 26, Registered users can check out

As a registered user
When I add items to my cart
And I visit my cart

That order is associated with my user
I am taken to my orders page ("/profile/orders")
I see a flash message telling me my order was created
I see my new order listed on my profile orders page
My cart is now empty
```

---

## User Order Show Page
The show page template for an order can be shared between users, merchants and admins to DRY up our presentation logic. They will operate through separate controllers, though.

### User Control
- Users can cancel an order if an admin has not "shipped" that order
- When an order is cancelled, any fulfilled items have their inventory returned to their respective merchants

### Merchant Control
- Merchants only see items in the order that are sold by that merchant
- Items from other merchants are hidden

### Admin Control
- Admins can cancel an order on behalf of a user
- Admins can fulfill items on order on behalf of a merchant

As an admin user
When I log into my dashboard, "/admin/dashboard"
Then I see any "packaged" orders ready to ship.
Next to each order I see a button to "ship" the order.

## Merchant Dashboard
This is the landing page when a merchant logs in. Here, they will see their contact information (but cannot change it), some statistics, and a list of pending orders that require the merchant's attention.

### Admins can act on behalf of merchants
Admin users will see more information on the "/merchants" route that all users see. For example, on this page, an admin user can navigate to each merchant's dashboard under a route like "/admin/merchants/7". This will allow the admin to perform every action that the merchant themselves can perform. Admin users can also "downgrade" a merchant account to become a user account.

## Rubric

| | **Feature Completeness** | **Rails** | **ActiveRecord** | **Testing and Debugging** | **Styling, UI/UX** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **4: Exceptional**  | All User Stories 100% complete including all sad paths and edge cases, and some extension work completed | Students implement strategies not discussed in class to effectively organize code and adhere to MVC. | Highly effective and efficient use of ActiveRecord beyond what we've taught in class. Even `.each` calls will not cause additional database lookups. | Very clear Test Driven Development. Test files are extremely well organized and nested. Students utilize `before :each` blocks. 100% coverage for features and models | Extremely well styled and purposeful layout. Excellent color scheme and font usage. All other rubric categories score 3 or 4. |
| **3: Passing** | Students complete all User Stories. No more than 2 Stories fail to correctly implement sad path and edge case functionality. All 37 user stories from part 1 were completed on time. | Students use the principles of MVC to effectively organize code. Students can defend any of their design decisions. Students limit access to authorized users. | ActiveRecord is used in a clear and effective way to read/write data using no Ruby to process data. | 100% coverage for models. 98% coverage for features. Tests are well written and meaningful. | Purposeful styling pattern and layout using `application.html.erb`. Links or buttons to reach all areas of the site. |
| **2: Passing with Concerns** | Students complete all but 1 - 3 User Stories | Students utilize MVC to organize code, but cannot defend some of their design decisions. Or some functionality is not limited to the appropriately authorized users. | Ruby is used to process data that could use ActiveRecord instead. | Feature test coverage between 90% and 98%, or model test coverage below 100%, or tests are not meaningfully written or have an unclear objective. | Styling is poor or incomplete. Incomplete navigation for some routes, i.e. users must manually type URLs. |
| **1: Failing** | Students fail to complete 4 or more User Stories | Students do not effectively organize code using MVC. Or students do not authorize users. | Ruby is used to process data more often than ActiveRecord | Below 90% coverage for either features or models. | No styling or no buttons or links to navigate the site. |
